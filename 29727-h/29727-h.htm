<h1><span class="sp1">ZERO DATA</span></h1>

<h2><small>By CHARLES SAPHRO</small></h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i><big>All the intricate, electronic witchery of the 21st century could not
pin guilt on fabulous Lonnie Raichi, the irreproachable philanthropist.
But Jason, the cop, was sweating it out ... searching
for that fourth and final and all-knowing rule that would knock
Lonnie's "triple ethic" for a gala loop.</big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Lonnie Raichi</span> was small, heavily
built, wet-eyed, dapper and successful.
His success he attributed entirely to
his philosophy.</p>

<p>Not knowing about Lonnie's philosophy,
the whole twenty-odd years of Lonnie's
success was the abiding crux of Jason's
disgust. And this, in spite of the more and
more men Jason came to control and the
fitful stream of new techniques and equipment
Gov-Pol and Gov-Mil Labs put at his
disposal.</p>

<p>Jason was a cop. In fact, by this Friday
the thirteenth in the fall of 2009, squirming
on what had come to be his pet Gov-Park
bench right across from the Tiara of
Wold in the Fane, he was only one step
short of being the Head Cop of Government
City. He was good. Gathering in a lot of
criminals was what had brought him up the
steps.</p>

<p>But he hadn't gathered in Lonnie.</p>

<p>It wasn't for lack for trying. Way back,
when Lonnie was known simply as
"Lonnie," Jason managed to get a little
help from his associates and superiors.
Sometimes.</p>

<p>But as Lonnie came to be known as Lon
Raichi, then Mr. Raichi, and finally as
"THE Launcelot Raichi" (to Everyone Who
Mattered), and as Jason's promotions kept
pace with his widening experience and painstakingly
acquired knowledge; peculiarly,
there seemed to be fewer and fewer persons
around who could be made interested in
"Lonnie."</p>

<p>Inside Government and Gov-Pol-Anx as
well as among the general Two-Worlds
public.</p>

<p>So Jason got less and less help, or even
passive cooperation, from his superiors. As
a matter of fact, the more men he could
command, the fewer he could use on anything
that could be construed as concerning
Lonnie.</p>

<p>Equipment, though, was a little different
matter. There was usually enough so that
one unit of a kind could be unobtrusively
trained on Mr. Raichi under the care of
Jason's own desk sergeant. In 1999, for
example, Moglaut, that erratic and secretive
genius in Physlab Nine, came out with a
quantum analyzer and probability reproducer.
The machine installed in Pol-Anx,
reconstructed crimes and identified the
probable criminals by their modus operandi
and the physical traces they couldn't avoid
leaving at the un-mercy of any of its portable
data accumulators.</p>

<p>On Jason's first attempt it almost came
close to Lonnie. It did gather in the hidden,
dead, still twitching, completely uncommunicative
carcasses of the five men who actually
relieved the vault of the Citizen's Bank of
Berlin of its clutch of millions. It even
identified the body of the rocopilot found
floating in the Potomac a few days later
as being one of the group, and the killer.
It did <i>not</i> locate the arsonized remnants of
the plane, though, nor the currency; and
only achieved the casting of a slight, or
subsidiary, third-hand aspersion in the
direction of THE Launcelot Raichi.</p>

<p>But Lonnie came up with an irrefutable
alibi, somehow, and the hassle that followed
made Jason's luck run out. And on Jason's
stubborn, secret, subsequent tries, all the
analyzer could produce was a report of zero
data whenever Jason, reasonably or unreasonably,
believed that Lonnie was involved.</p>

<p>Every time.</p>

<p>Zero data when Schicklehitler's marshal's
baton disappeared from the British Museum.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/001.png" width="334" height="550" alt="" title="" />
<small><b><i>Lonnie on his dream throne ... Jason at his instruments.
Was the struggle endless between these two?</i></b></small></div>

<p>Zero data when Charlemagne's Crown
lapsed unobtrusively from its shrine in
Vienna during the Year 2000 Celebration.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Jason realized that the
Berlin job in 1999 had marked Lonnie's
last essay after money. Other things seemed
to occupy Lonnie's mind after he'd sprouted
publicly into the status of full-fledged,
hyper-respectable, inter-planetary business
tycoon; complete with a many-tentacled
industrial organization in Moon Colony and
a far-flung prospecting unit headquartering
at Mars Equatorial.</p>

<p>Tycoonship was a status with which
Everyone Who Mattered was always
pleased.</p>

<p>Jason's next attempt on Lonnie had to
wait until 2005 and was the result of two
unconnected circumstances. The first was
Physlab Nine's secretive genius, Moglaut,
evolving another piece of equipment, a disarmer,
which, subsequent to its first use,
saved countless cops' lives. The second was
the discovery in the Valley of Kings, of
Amenhotep III's own personal official
Uraeus. Positively identified beyond the
shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>Jason, playing the hunch he'd built up
about Lonnie, rushed a man, armed with
the brand new disarmer, instantly to the
scene.</p>

<p>The next morning, Amenhotep's Uraeus
was gone and the corpse of Jason's man was
found&mdash;part of it. The right hand, arm,
shoulder, and most of the head were missing;
burned away. And of the disarmer,
only a fused hunk of mixed metals and
silver helix remained.</p>

<p>And the analyzer reported zero data.</p>

<p>Lab Nine's taciturn and exasperating
Moglaut failed to derive an explanation for
either circumstance.</p>

<p>"I won't shut up," Jason said, standing
on the carpet in front of his superior. "He
did it. I don't know how, but he did."</p>

<p>Another spasm of frustration shook him
and he slammed his fist down on the sacred
desk. "I've known Lonnie all my life. I
know he doesn't know phfut about anything
scientific, and yet he makes a horse's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain Jason, I insist that you stop
referring to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Makes a&mdash;" Jason raised his voice,
"horse's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"CAPTAIN JASON!"</p>

<p>Jason subsided.</p>

<p>"Captain, Annex has been most forbearing
all these years. We've overlooked your
incomprehensible phobia&mdash;this&mdash;this confoundedly
unfounded impossible bias
against such an irreproachable philanthropist
as Launcelot Raichi&mdash;because of the sterling
quality of your ... ah ... other work. However&mdash;"</p>

<p>On the desk, the Commissioner's fingers
took up a measured tattoo. "&mdash;should this
fixed idea begin to encroach on&mdash;uh&mdash;uh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right ... Sir." Sullenly, Jason submitted.
"I understand."</p>

<p>With a self-congratulatory smirk up at
the ceiling that separated them from Executive
Level, the bland face of the Commissioner
smoothed out. "All right, Captain,
as long as we understand each other ..."</p>

<p>Sourly, Jason got himself back to his own
office. Drumming his own fingers on his
own desk and glaring at his own desk
sergeant, he purged his soul.</p>

<p>"&mdash;damned equipment would only work,
I'd gather him in! They couldn't stop me,
then! But&mdash;" Jason choked. When he could
speak again, "He's never studied a lick in
his life, I tell you! Yet he makes a he-cow's
behind out of the best man and the best
scientific equipment Annex can provide!
How? How, I ask you! He doesn't know the
first blasted thing about any blasted thing
in any blasted science!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">That</span> was true. Conversely, Jason didn't
know about Lonnie's philosophy.</p>

<p>Nowadays, Lonnie called it a "philosophy."
He told reporters it was "based on a
triple ethic." (Inside his skull, a small boy
jumped up and down in glee over the
magnificent language he was able to use.)
But he always replied only with a superior
smile when asked by reporters to put the
philosophy and the triple ethic into words.
If pressed, he paraphrased an Ancient Man:
"You know my works. Judge by them."</p>

<p>He was referring, of course, to his having
branched out into patronizing the Arts.
He'd even erected Raichi Museum just
across the velvety green circle of Gov-Park
from Government's own Fane of Artifacts.</p>

<p>The reporters would go away and write
more articles about his modesty and the
superlative treasures of Earth, Moon and
Mars that were gathered in the Raichi
Galleries; protected, the papers always
boasted, by the same ultra-safety mechanisms
that guarded the mile-long, one-gallery-wide,
glass-fronted Fane itself. Government
affably made up two of every anti-break-and-entry
device nowadays. One for the
Fane and the other for Raichi Museum.</p>

<p>Despite occasional grumbles in the letters-to-the-editor
columns, the papers never
seemed to inquire into why so many priceless
trans-worlds artifacts got into Lonnie's
private ownership instead of Government's
public Fane. And while some artists and
architects (unendowed by Lonnie) succeeded
in publicly proclaiming Raichi
Museum gaudy, such carpings were but
to be expected, particularly from modernists.</p>

<p>Actually, Everyone Who Mattered felt
Raichi Museum's granite walls were much
more dignified than the narrow, glass-faced
arcade that was the Fane, wide open to the
most disrespectfully casual public inspection
all the time. Why, even late at night gawking
loiterers pressed their noses against the
glass; black, clumsy images pinned to the
blazing whiteness hurled by radionic tubes
against the back wall of snowy marble from
Mars' arctic quarries. Besides, that glass,
proof though it was against anything but
an atomic explosion, still made every true
art lover feel disquietingly insecure.</p>

<p>No, on the whole, the papers and reporters
and true art lovers who felt the Public's
treasures should be more secure than visible,
never questioned Lonnie's doing good to so
much Art.</p>

<p>Thus, nowadays, nobody did anything but
accept Lonnie. Except Jason. And he, perforce,
took out his disgust not on hounding
the sacrosanct Lonnie, but on that crackpot,
mumchance, captive genius of Physlab
Nine. With the result that, late in 2007,
Pol-Anx had an electronic servo-tracer.</p>

<p>Pending construction of sufficient hundreds
of thousands more for full Anx use,
Jason swore Lab Nine to secrecy and installed
the pilot model in his own office.
He had enough authority for that.</p>

<p>It was a hellishly unbuildable and deceptively
simple gadget, that tracer. Simply
tune it in on the encephalo-aura, the brain
wave pattern of any individual ... and
monitor. It never let go until deliberately
switched off by the operator. It tracked;
pinpointed the subject accurately up to
twenty thousand miles. It stopped humming
and started panting in proportionately ascending
decibels when the subject became
tense, nervous, afraid. It also directed
pocket-sized trackers of its own Damoclean
beam. It made it a cinch to gather in known
criminals in the very midst of their first
subsequent flagrante delicto.</p>

<p>Jason latched the servo-tracer on Lonnie
and settled down to wait.</p>

<p>At 10 p.m., local mean time, January
25, 2008, the tracer hiccupped and, all by
itself, <i>went to sleep</i>!</p>

<p>Jason blinked. Jiggled the gadget. Swore.
Either the gadget was haywire or Lonnie
was up to something, and, as usual, was
making a&mdash;</p>

<p>Jason bawled for four reliable squad men
he'd mentally selected before. If he could
find Lonnie&mdash;catch Lonnie in actual performance
of an act&mdash;then Commissioner or
no Commissioner, Executive Level or no
Executive Level...!</p>

<p>He roared from Pol-Anx with the men,
past the flank of Government Fane, across
the Park and around the bulk of Raichi
Museum to Lonnie's mansion in its shadow.
Leaped from the gyro-van, sweeping his
men out into a fan for the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Nothing. Placid. Tree-shadowed, lawn-swept
streets, ebony and silver in the light
the moon reflected from solar space.</p>

<p>He'd missed. Too late. Lonnie was gone ... or
was he?</p>

<p>Jason didn't give himself time to think;
his men time to get even a momentary
hesitation started. He shoved his thumb
hard against the door chimes and his shield
under the butler's nose.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Raichi was at home. Then, after
an interval nicely calculated to allow Jason
to feel how acutely precarious his position
stood, "Mr. Raichi is accessible."</p>

<p>Lonnie was bland. Blandly accepting
Jason's urgent story of a known ... er ... jewel
thief traced to the neighborhood.
Blandly amenable to Jason's suggestion that
his men be permitted to go over the mansion
(once he'd started this damfool caper, he
had to go through with it). Lonnie so bland
that Jason felt a skitter of perspiration down
his backbone while his men hustled up the
soaring circle of the stair.</p>

<h3><big>II</big></h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Since</span> I've been disturbed anyway,"
Lonnie offered, "I'll show you
around."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Jason shook his head stiffly.
"I'll just wait."</p>

<p>"I think you should come."</p>

<p>Shrugging, Jason followed, eyes stubbornly
downcast.</p>

<p>"... my library ... my den ... bar.
Care for a drink? Well, suit yourself." As
the lights of the den dimmed and one wall
swooshed smoothly into the ceiling. "My
theatre ... The usual tri-di stereo, of course,
but I've had a couple of the new tight beams
installed to channel Moon and Mars on the
cube. Much better than the usual staged
bilge. Say, that reminds me, a couple hours
ago Mars projector had a scanner on one
of the exploration parties caught out in a
psychosonic storm. Jove, did they wriggle!
Even in atomsuits they were better than
Messalina Magdalen working on her last
G-string. Here, I'll switch it on. Maybe the
rescue team's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Building up inside the hundreds of thousands
of layers of crystallized plastic came
a reddish, three-dimensional landscape, as
if viewed from a height. Orange dust
swirled across a gaunt, clawed plain under
a transparent pink haze. A feeling as of
sub-visual vibration, emanating from the
cube, tugged at Jason's eyelids.</p>

<p>No life.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Nope; they've cleaned up the carcasses
already. Too bad. Tell you what, though.
Next time I catch it happening, I'll phone
you and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't bother."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself." Lonnie shifted and went
on, lightly. "I'm not at all satisfied with the
color, are you? It's off a little, don't you
think?... Well?... Well!"</p>

<p>Unwillingly, Jason moved his attention
to the cube. Eyes widening, he studied it.
"No. You're wrong. That's good! The tech
who poured that stereo did a damned good
job. It's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not good enough for me! That's not
exactly what I saw up at Vulcan City. If
those lazy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look, you can't expect exactly the same
reflectivity from crystallized plastic that you
get from molecules of atmosphere, no matter
how scientifically the pouring and layering
is controlled. It's&mdash;they're two different
materials. Leaving aside the ion-index differential
and quality of incident light, you
still can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can ..." As the pause lengthened,
Jason's gaze was finally drawn to Lonnie's
face. "You still haven't changed a bit, have
you, Jasey? Still all wrapped up in <i>how</i> any
collection of doodads work instead of just
for what it'll do. You know, I wouldn't be
surprised if that hasn't always been the
difference between us. Where's it got you?"</p>

<p>Jason strode for the door.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute." Lonnie's voice came
louder. "Better wait, copper. I'm not
through ... That's better."</p>

<p>From behind Jason came the sound of
rubbing palms. "We've come a long way
from Gimlet Street, haven't we, Jasey? You
particularly. Captain. Promotions. Pay
raises ..." Then Lonnie was in front of
him, staring up. "You're quite a substantial
citizen now. Yes? Well, look at that.
Go on, look at it."</p>

<p>Against the side wall stood a gigantic
triptych. More than life size, the central
panel canopied the statue of a Mongol potentate;
the two side wings, a pair of guards
in bas-relief. All three wrought in chryselephantine
gold and ivory; the gold with
flowing pallid highlights. Damascened
armor, encrusted with jewels, girdled the
chest of the Asiatic Prince; helmeted the
sullen head carved from a single immensity
of ivory.</p>

<p>Ruby eyes glared arrogantly under ebon
brows. Against the statue's folded shins, its
pommel negligently gripped by one immovable,
ivory hand, leaned a short Turkish
scimitar of watered steel. Beneath the carved
hassock upon which the statue sat, a dais of
three steps fell away to the floor.</p>

<p>"That's Genghis Khan," Lonnie said. "I
had him made. That isn't gold he's made
of; that's aureum&mdash;and it cost plenty to have
the silver mixed in. It makes it better. And
I get the best! A hundred thousand, it cost
me. And thirty-six thousand more to brace
the wall and floor. It's good. It's the best
that's made!"</p>

<p>He came up on tiptoe, thrusting his chin
as close as possible to Jason's averted face.
"Why don't you buy one for your place,
Captain?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jason</span> stared into the malevolent eyes of
the statue.</p>

<p>"Huh ... hu-hu ... hu-ha-ha-ha ..."
At the dais, Lonnie put his foot on the
second step and patted Genghis Khan familiarly
on one ivory knee. "I like this old boy.
He had the right idea. I have it. You
haven't. You never had. If you had, you'd'a
listened to the proposition I made you way
back then. Remember when Aggie told you
about it? Say, I wonder what's become of
her, anyway. Do you know? What? What'd
you say?"</p>

<p>Jason cleared his throat. Hard.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Jason swallowed. Blood pounded in his
temples.</p>

<p>"Jasey, you're stupid."</p>

<p>Jason made his eyes close. Let them re-open
slowly.</p>

<p>"You were born stupid and you've stayed
stupid."</p>

<p>Still Jason held back an answer.</p>

<p>"You're nothing but a stupid, go-where-you're-sent,
do-what-you're-told cop! What
do you say to that! If you want to keep on
being one, answer me! Answer me!"</p>

<p>Deliberately, Jason jerked his chin at the
statue. "That's another example of what I
mean."</p>

<p>"<i>What?!!</i>" screamed Lonnie.</p>

<p>"Reflectivity. The silver in the gold. Two
different metals and where they're not well
fused. That sword blade, too. Just the misalignment
of molecules in the surface of the
steel makes it look wavy, and ripple when
the light changes or you move. Different
even in two parts of the same material.
That's why you can't get the stereo cube to
reproduce color-feel exactly." Breathing
heavily, Jason had to let his voice fade out.</p>

<p>"Gaaa ..." Lonnie convulsed. "Who
cares!" Laugh sounds rolled out of his
throat. "You'll never change."</p>

<p>He flicked his hand at Jason, brushing
him away.</p>

<p>But, as Jason, white-faced, herded his
men out through the costly grandeurs of the
vestibule, Lonnie called from the inner
hall: "Copper ..."</p>

<p>Jason turned, waited.</p>

<p>"You amused me, so it's all right this
time. You can keep your penny-ante job.
But don't try for me again. You cross my
path again, I'll smear you. And what's more,
I'll use whatever you're trying, to smear
you with. Get that! Get it good! Now get
out!"</p>

<p>Back in Jason's office, the desk sergeant
reported as Jason came in. "Funny thing.
That there tracer started to hum again soon
after you was out for a while. Quit again
'bout five minutes ago, though."</p>

<p>Jason gritted his teeth, banished the sergeant,
and spent five minutes alone gripping
the edge of his desk. Then he yanked Lab
Nine's silent genius down to his office. That
didn't help for the tracer stayed asleep. Not
even a hiccup rewarded Moglaut's most
active efforts on Lonnie's wave length. On
others, fine. Through the night and on into
the next day, Jason kept Moglaut at work.</p>

<p>Late in the morning, Authority at Peiping
televised publicly that the Mace of Alexander
was gone from its satin pillow in the
proof-glass case in the alarm-wired room
off the machine-weapon-guarded main corridor
of the security-policed Temple of
Mankind.</p>

<p>The Mace, symbol of Alexander's power,
was a pretty little baton barely two feet
long. Its staff was mastodon ivory, the paleontologists
had determined. One end
sported a solid ball of gold hardly as big
as a fist; studded with rubies, but none set
quite so close as to actually touch.</p>

<p>The other end, balancing the ball of gold,
mounted the largest single polished emerald
crystal in the discovered universe. Neither
the Moon or Mars had produced anything
in the emerald line equivalent to what had
come out of the mists of Earthly history.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Disregarding</span> the bulletin, Jason
kept Moglaut at the servo-tracer. In
the night's smallest hours it began placidly
to hum on Lonnie's aura again.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Jason said. "What
did you do?"</p>

<p>Moglaut shrugged.</p>

<p>"You must have done something. What
was it?"</p>

<p>Moglaut, not looking up from the purring
machine, shook his head.</p>

<p>"All right. You can go now." Jason
watched the genius disappear hurriedly
through the door. From the door he
watched the man scutter down the long,
long corridor out of sight. The first thing
in the morning, Jason promised himself,
he'd have a session about Moglaut with
Lab Nine's chief.</p>

<p>The first thing in the morning brought
word that Lab Nine's erratic genius had
stumbled himself out of the seventeenth-floor
window of his suburban apartment to
his death. Lab Nine's chief clucked sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Jason shook his head and wondered.
After exhaustive investigation (zero data)
he still wondered. That's all he was able to
do, wonder.</p>

<p>The second time Jason's servo-tracer on
Lonnie hiccupped and dozed off was at
12:01 a.m., August 7th, 2008, just one day
after the Diamond Throne arrived on Earth.
The single, glittering diamond crystal, misshapen
like an armchair and larger than
one, had been mined out of the core of
Tycho's crater. And it was also just two
days before the Moon Throne would have
been installed in the unbreakable safety of
Raichi Museum!</p>

<p>"Jason, you're insane," his superior told
him when Jason, reinforced by an astounding
public furore, brought the matter up.
"He owned it. He had no reason to steal it
from himself. Besides, one man alone
couldn't budge that enormous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It won't do any harm to look-see."</p>

<p>"It can do a lot of harm!" The Commissioner
glanced quickly at the ceiling. "I'll
have nothing to do with it. That's all."</p>

<p>Officially, Jason's hands were tied. But
secretly he maneuvered the transfer of a
five-layers-down undercover man from
Madras to Government City. And, coincidentally,
in the ordinary routine of operation,
Raichi Museum took on a new janitor;
a little brown man who grinned constantly
and was fanatical about dust. He was a
good, reliable man and when he reported
that neither the Diamond Throne nor any
of the other missing glories were anywhere
in the Museum, Jason had to believe him.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it wouldn't have done
Jason any good to have installed the little
brown man in Lonnie's mansion, either.
The lock&mdash;not the apparent one openly in
the den door, but the real one&mdash;was as
unobtrusive and foolproof as twenty-first-century
engineering could make it. And
Lonnie always made sure he was alone and
unobserved in the den before he locked it
and sauntered across to bestow a peculiar,
multiple tweak to the nose of Genghis
Khan.</p>

<p>He enjoyed the gesture. On Christmas
Eve he grinned broadly while the triptych
pivoted in the wall, let him off in the
Kruppmartite-walled, pulsing radiance of
his very secret, very, very personal throne
room, and swung back into place.</p>

<p>His grin changed to an expression of
imperial dignity as he encased himself in
Catherine the Great's ermine Robe of State
and grasped the Mace of Alexander in his
good left hand. But then the royal mien
gave way to a sullen scowl as he hesitated
between Charlemagne's Crown and Amenhotep's
Uraeus.</p>

<p>Actually, neither one was worthy of him.
Both purely regional coronets belonged over
in the farthest dusty corner behind the curtain,
along with Schicklehitler's shabby
baton and that crummy Peacock Throne.
What he really needed was a crown worthily
symbolic of the position he'd make it possible
to publicly assume in the not-too-distant
future.</p>

<p>It was a damned imposition that he had
to put up with. Well, he'd make them do
since they were the best to be had. Adjusting
the Crown of Charlemagne upon his
brow, he stood on tiptoe to wriggle his way
back into the embrace of the titanic crystal
that was the Diamond Throne. There, he
relaxed and gave himself over to the contemplation
of the glories of Lonnie.</p>

<p>Who but he had developed such an efficient
philosophy to such an unfailingly incisive
point? Certainly not Old Boswell
who, back in the early days had thought to
be teaching him.</p>

<p>"Rule One, my boy," he remembered the
old patrician twittering, "there's always
someone to pull your chestnuts out of the
fire for you&mdash;for a price. Pay it. Then add a
plus to the payment and the man's yours
to use again and again."</p>

<p>But even in those days as a callow, trusting
youth, he'd been smarter than Boswell.
Observing, from the safety of the sidelines,
the way the old fool had finally tripped up,
he'd added a codicil of his own to Rule
One: "Make sure the payment's <i>final</i>!"</p>

<p>(... witness the Berlin chestnut pullers.
And the unobtrusive and undiscovered spate
of their predecessors whose usefulness had
become outweighed ...)</p>

<p>Then Boswell had said, "Rule Two: You
don't have to know the how of anything.
All you have to know is <i>the man who does</i>.
He always has a price. The currency is
usually odd, but find it, pay it, then proceed
per Rule One."</p>

<p>Even tonight, in his own Throne Room,
Lonnie flushed heavily at the way he'd
accepted at face value what came next. "By
the way," Old Boswell had added smoothly,
"no connection of course, my boy, but the
topic reminded me. Here are the keys to that
daffodil-hued tri-phibian you ogled at
Sporter's exhibit. I must admit you have an
eye for dashing machinery even though I
can't agree with your esthetics. No&mdash;no ...
It's yours. I feel that you've earned it and
more by&mdash;"</p>

<p>He'd rushed to the garage to gloat over
the mono-cyclic, gyro-stabilized, U-powered
model with the seat that flattened into a
convenient bed at the touch of a button.
The tri-phib, he recalled, in which he'd
coaxed Agnes into taking her first ride.</p>

<h3><big>III</big></h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> details of that recollection brought
up his spirits again and, he reminded
himself, the lesson had sunk in; had developed
into his most useful ethic. After his
narrow scrape with Jason's quantum analyzer
in the Berlin incident, it hadn't taken
long for a good, one-man detective agency
to locate Physlab Nine's frenetic genius,
Moglaut. It had taken longer to discover
Moglaut's currency but, after much shadowing,
the 'tec had come through handsomely.
Lonnie, automatically applying his fully-developed
Ethic One, always considered it
a nice sentimental touch that the one-man
agency's final case was successful.</p>

<p>Moglaut's price was a prim, brunette
soprano who wore her eyes disguised behind
heavy tortoiseshell. The ill-cut garb she
could afford added greatly to her staid
appearance, obscuring a certain full-bodied
litheness. She earned a throttled existence
soloing at funerals and in the worship halls
of obscure, rigidly fanatic offshoot sects.</p>

<p>Her consuming passion was to be an
opera prima donna.</p>

<p>Lonnie never tried to understand why
Moglaut sat fascinated through endless sin-busting
sermons and lachrymose requiems.
To hurry afterwards, with the jerky motions,
the glazed eyes of a zombie, to subsequent
rendezvous with the soprano at his suburban
apartment. It was entirely sufficient
in Lonnie's philosophy that Moglaut did.</p>

<p>The soprano's continuing suburban cooperation
was insured by Lonnie's judicious
doling out of exactly the cash to keep a
tenth-rate opera company barely functioning
in a lesser quarter of Government City.
Oddly, he found it pleased him and from
that grew his wide patronizing of the Arts.</p>

<p>The immediate result of the situation he
created and controlled so deftly was Moglaut's
production of a closed-plenum grid
suit.</p>

<p>None of Gov-Pol, Gov-Mil or Gov-Econ
labs found out about it; much less Pol-Anx
or Government itself. Moglaut did all
the work in the tiny complete lab Lonnie set
up in the suburbs.</p>

<p>Lonnie didn't care what electronic witchery
took place in the minute spatial interstices
between the finely-woven mesh of
flexible tantalum. Sufficient for him, the
silvery white suit once donned and triple-zipped
through hood and glove-endings, he
was immune to ordinary Earthly phenomena;
free to move about, do what he wished,
untraceably. In it, his words were not vulnerable
to the sono-beam's eavesdropping.
Photo-electric and magneto-photonic watchdogs
ignored him. Even the most delicately
sensitive thermo-couples continued their
dreams of freezing flame undisturbed.
Jason's quantum analyzer couldn't pick up
the leavings of a glance&mdash;all that the suit
permitted out into the physical world.</p>

<p>The suit had its limitations, of course.
Lonnie could see out, but the suit could also
be seen. That required sometimes intricate
advance planning to offset. Also, occasionally,
manipulating the field of the grid to
permit mechanical contact with the physical
world was a trifle cumbersome but never
annoyingly so. All it took was a modicum
of step-by-step thought and some care not
to leave a personal trace for the quantum
analyzer to pick up. No actual trouble. And,
finally, Moglaut had warned that the compact
power unit pocketed on the left breast
had a half-life of only thirteen years.</p>

<p>That left Lonnie placid. He took the suit
for granted and used it for what it let him
do.</p>

<p>When something more was needed, he
was convinced his philosophy would provide
it.</p>

<p>He didn't waste time trying to determine
whether possession of the suit or previous
experiences leading to his insistence on its
development brought into focus the third
ethic of his philosophy: "Rules One and
Two are valuable and have their use. But
when the chips are really down, <i>do it yourself</i>!"
Instead, he toddled about personally
acquiring the trappings of omnipotent
royalty with little thought for the means.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> while he was about that business,
the very limitations of the grid suit
furnished an unending challenge to Moglaut's
genius. And out of a sideline experiment
incited by that challenge came the
disarmer which Jason greeted with such
fruitless glee.</p>

<p>Fruitless because, of course, before turning
the disarmer over to Lab Nine and Pol-Anx,
Moglaut devised a new, infinitely
stronger, more versatile power pack for
Lonnie's suit. A power pack controlled by a
simple rheostat in the palm of the left-hand
glove, but whose energy derived from the
electron-kinetic properties of pent and
shielded tritium. Not simple. In fact, solving
the problem of penning and shielding tritium
in a portable package delayed the appearance
of Jason's disarmer two whole
years.</p>

<p>That power pack and the reciprocating
properties of the fields of the grid suit
itself made a dilly of a combination. Before,
the closed-plenum mesh kept Lonnie from
leaving traces. Now, anything once embraced
within the palpitating fields of the
grid moved with and how the suit moved;
not in accord with the natural laws of the
surrounding continuum. That neat new attribute
took care of the cubic yard or so of
Diamond Throne.</p>

<p>And the ravenous tritium was malignant.
Let any external power be applied against
the plenum and it would be smashed, hurled
back full force upon its source.</p>

<p>Jason had an undiagnosed example of
that when he got only part of his man back
from the Valley of Kings.</p>

<p>It was the power-pack-grid-suit combo
that made a sleeping Buddha of the servo-tracer
on the night of Jason's call at Lonnie's
mansion; bollixed up the elaborate guards
of the Peiping Temple of Mankind;
and, when Jason so openly displayed suspicion
of the genius, made child's play of
what the newspapers headlined as "Scientist's
Amazing Suicide Love Pact."</p>

<p>Lonnie grinned, remembering the incident.
Then other memories&mdash;things he'd
witnessed through a tight-beam scanner
secreted in the suburban apartment&mdash;crowded
his mind; stirring him restlessly on
the Diamond Throne. Divesting himself of
imperial appurtenances, he started for a
certain locked file in the den to check the
specifications of available per-diem empresses.</p>

<p>Making sure the triptych was snugly in
place behind him, he paused to flip the
switch on the stereo cube. Maybe Messalina
Magdalen or one of the lesser ecdysiasts was
presenting the perfection of her techniques
over the private channel at the moment, an
event he would appreciate.</p>

<p>Instead, the private channel presented, as
the cube glowed and cleared, the same red,
clawed landscape he'd shown to Jason
months before. The disembodied voice of
the commentator on Mars&mdash;not the lyrical
public announcer, but the industrial economist
who served the private channel&mdash;picked
up in mid-word: "... early to have
much data on the science and material resources
this dead civilization possessed, but
I recommend that every Corporation in
Induscomm Cabal should place a technical
party at Mars Equatorial as soon as possible.
We shall now key in with the public spacecast.
Note the texture and color range of the
adornments and artifacts. I venture that
these items will prove popular among you
who can well afford such rare treasures.
However, subtlety in acquiring them is suggested.
While common clamor for Public
ownership is under control, overt provocation
is not recommended. Here is the cut-over ..."</p>

<p>The scene in the cube flashed and coalesced,
dazzling Lonnie's eyes for a moment.
He was conscious of the landscape rushing
"up"; of gigantic walls and spires rising
out of the obscurity of a quarried chasm to
tower briefly against the pink haze of the
Martian sky, then expand to give the impression
of engulfing him before the scanner
lens settled under the center of a leaping,
vaulted dome.</p>

<p>To Lonnie, the many-acred enclosure
meant nothing with its shimmering, stone-lace
pillars, its tapestries that flamed with
color or traced ghostlike, barely discernible
outlines on the walls. Nor did any thought
enter his mind of the exactness of the reflected
color in the stereo cube. Hands
clenched into aching fists, he stood leaning
forward; striving by sheer will-power to
span the void of space and force the scanner
lens closer to the truncated pyramid of steps
atop which, on a block of plain black stone,
a dessicated mummy sat erect, hands folded
in its reedy lap and on its head a blazing,
coruscating radiance.</p>

<p>A <i>Crown</i>!</p>

<h3><big>IV</big></h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dazedly</span>, Lonnie was conscious of the
public announcer's rhapsodizing: "...
Gov-Anth's ethnologists and linguistics
experts are making some progress toward
deciphering the inscription carved on the
plaque. Wait! Here's a note from Gawley
Worin. You remember Gawley Worin, our
famous leg-man, folks, don't you? Well,
here's a note. It ... Listen to this, folks!
Listen! This is the beginning of the first
rough translation of the inscription.
Listen ...</p>

<p>"'We, Wold, last of the Imperial Family
of Wold who exercise our Power from
Wold, the Imperial City, throughout Wold,
the Planet. We, last of the line of Wold,
who alone may wear the Tiara which is Our
Power, and our Symbol of Power, and the
Symbol of Our Power throughout all the
edos of Raii's life-taking light, without fear,
facing the fate&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Hissing, Lonnie cut the stereo switch.
He'd seen enough. Darting across the den,
he opened his communico. "Get me Sykes
in our Mars unit," he ordered the operator.
"Make sure what I say is scrambled. While
you're waiting, get through to Denisen at
Gov-Forn, then Raikes at Gov-Planet, then
Butchwaeu in Gov-Int. And keep this line
closed&mdash;that means you, too&mdash;while I'm
talking."</p>

<p>Lonnie&mdash;THE Launcelot Raichi&mdash;was
going after what he wanted.</p>

<p>Just under a mile away, Jason turned
from the public stereo in the rotunda of
Pol-Anx. Tapping the cold bit of his pipe
against his teeth as he walked, he sought the
ease of his chair. In the privacy of his office
he began to ponder.</p>

<p>The months' developments gave him no
surprise. Because it was the first contact
Humanity had had with a non-human race,
the Mars discoveries made an overwhelming
impression on the man in the street. The
result was that for the first time in Post-Synthesis
history all artifacts were reserved
for Earth Public!!!</p>

<p>Everyone Who Mattered screamed, except
Lonnie. He evinced a biding calmness while
attending the ceremonies marking the installation
of the Tiara of Wold in the exact
center of Government's own Fane of Artifacts;
even smiling benignly on certain Gov-Ficials
who seemed to perspire more than
the coolness of the evening warranted.</p>

<p>Jason, loitering on the grass of Gov-Park,
noted the smile and the perspiration. The
perspirers reminded him of small boys
expecting a whipping.</p>

<p>Once the dedication ceremonies were
over, Lonnie never returned to the Fane to
examine the Tiara.</p>

<p>It was Jason the Tiara seemed to fascinate.
He spent more and more time, particularly
evenings, crouching on the bench in Gov-Park
across from the Tiara, ignoring the
constant stream of awed tourists silhouetted
against the blaze of light. He kept in constant
touch with his desk sergeant through
his pocket communico, so Annex business
didn't suffer. And the summer was warm,
to say the least, so that several Gov-Ficials
were almost regretful that the dignity of
their positions forbade following Jason's
example.</p>

<p>But then, too, no mere cop had their
responsibilities.</p>

<p>None of them was conscious of how
habitually Jason frowned, scratched his
head, moved uneasily on the pleasant bench.
Occasionally, he would snap his fingers and
the frown would relax. He'd switch on the
communico and speak briefly. Immediately
thereafter, one or the other of the hand-picked
four in Jason's personal squad would
raise his eyebrows slightly&mdash;safely, since the
pocket communico did not project video&mdash;and
take up a new position or new duties.
Or, an equipment unit in Op-room at Anx
would be indifferently retuned by heedless
techs.</p>

<p>Then for a while Jason would vent smoke
pleasantly from his malodorous pipe until
the frown would settle back between his
eyebrows and he'd begin to squirm on the
bench again, glancing warily at Executive
Level, feeling helpless about the inadequacy
of his resources.</p>

<p>But Lonnie had gotten over feeling sad
about <i>his</i> resources months earlier.</p>

<p>The night he'd returned from the Tiara
ceremonies he'd locked himself in his den
and let the on-view smile his face was wearing
lapse. He tweaked Genghis Khan's nose
viciously and slammed himself down in the
Diamond Throne without donning a single
imperial trapping, pounding his fist on the
cool mineral facet and staring morosely at
the grid suit hanging in its place on the
wall.</p>

<p>The grid suit wouldn't help him this time.
The cover-alls that had everything except
the necessary invisibility to&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Invisibility!</i></p>

<p>Slowly, Lonnie began to grin. Very little
later he had an obscure biochemist hooked,
and ended his instructions with: "... don't
care if it needs concentrated essence of
chameleon juice. Invent it. And it better
work for there's going to be a total shortage
of neo-hyperacth at two-twenty-eight per cc
for wifey!"</p>

<p>The biochemist delivered. Lonnie didn't
stop to question if it really was essence of
chameleon juice. He hurried with the
beaker of viscous fluid to his throne room,
drenched every square centimeter of the
grid suit with it and watched breathlessly
through the hours while it dried.</p>

<p>In the glowing, shadowless illumination,
the suit gradually disappeared. First, the
wall against which it hung shone mistily
through it. Then there was wall, slightly
outlined by a greyish cast. And at last, only
an indescribable fuzziness that had to be
sensed rather than seen.</p>

<h3><big>V</big></h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He took</span> the fuzziness off its hanger
and threw it up in the air toward the
center light. The light was undimmed. The
fuzziness was air. It sprawled down across
the Throne and became diamond, except for
the sleeve that dangled; part air, part intricately
patterned Persian carpet. It wasn't a
fuzziness, exactly, it was more of a faint
tone of difference in the color-texture feel.
It was as though what was behind the suit
was miraculously translated to its facing
surface and then reflected to the eye within
the nth of utter fidelity.</p>

<p>Grinning, slowly Lonnie's lower lip crept
out and up to squeeze its mate. Then, because
it was always better to be sure, he
donned the suit to try it against a variety
of experimental backgrounds, indoors and
out.</p>

<p>Over at Pol-Anx, the servo-tracer went
to sleep; the desk sergeant yanked the creaking
joints of his bunioned feet down off
Jason's desk; on the bench in Gov-Park,
Jason's communico squeaked briefly and
Jason and his four men rose to emergency
alert.</p>

<p>Two hours later, the Wold Tiara still
coruscating in the Fane's blaze of light,
the servo-tracer picked up its placid humming.
Jason's communico squeaked again
and Jason's men relaxed while Jason himself
clutched his head with both hands and
whispered bitter things.</p>

<p>At the same time, Lonnie, whistling
cheerfully, drew his legs out of the suit,
shook it straight and hung it back on the
wall. He was sure now. As sure as he was
that the little biochemist and his wife and
quintet of daughters would not want for
neo-hyperacth or anything else any longer.
He giggled a little, thinking of Jason
crouched on the bench, glaring vacantly,
utterly unconscious of Lonnie passing across
the grass so close beside him.</p>

<p>At his own convenience, Lonnie selected
his night; a full-moon night because his
now-invisible grid suit didn't require dark.
He picked a fairly early hour, too, because
what matter if a few yawps gawked as the
Tiara vanished? And that one of those
yawps would be Jason, stodgily on his
bench, gave Lonnie an extra fillip. Perhaps
it was just for this he'd let Jason plug along
on a cold trail all these years.</p>

<p>So that night, wearily from his bench in
Gov-Park, Jason looked up at Friday the
13th's full moon swimming amiably through
its own reflected night-brightness. His brain,
tired of its everlasting shuttle between
worries, presented him with a disconnected
memory-fact: "As cited by Zollner," Jason
found himself quoting a forgotten textbook,
"the Moon's reflectivity is point one seven
four ... Nuts!" Angrily, he broke off,
thumbed the button of his communico,
growled into the microphone on his lapel,
"Report."</p>

<p>"Adams," came promptly back. "West
Entry. Nothing."</p>

<p>"McGillis. Patrolling rear wall. All clear
in both directions as far as I can see. An' I
can see both ends of the Fane in all this
moonlight, Chief."</p>

<p>"Holland. At Raichi House. Nothing."</p>

<p>"Johnson. East Entry. More of the same."
Then, "Say, Jase, how about it? These
double shifts are getting me."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, now?"</p>

<p>"My feet hurt, Jase. Neither one of us is
as young as we used to be, remember. How
about knocking off?"</p>

<p>"Hmphf ..." Johnson, Jason thought,
was getting old. He'd been a good man in
his day but&mdash; Hey, he was still a good man!
It was Jason's own stubbornness that was
wearing Johnson down. Jason's useless
stubbornness. After all, without the backing
of Anx or Gov, without results from the
equipment he had filched to use on Lonnie,
what was the use of everlastingly sticking
around the Tiara like a fly buzzing molasso-saccharine
anyway? Jason opened his mouth
to send them all home, pressed the communico
button and&mdash;shelved the relieving
order temporarily. Instead, he blasted into
the microphone: "Sergeant! SERGEANT!"</p>

<p>From the communico, an intermittent
drone became a gasping gulp; changed into
a violent yawn and only then turned into
startled speech. "Yeah? Huh?... Yeah,
Chief!"</p>

<p>"Sergeant, if I ever catch you asleep
again, you won't ever get your pension."</p>

<p>"Chief, I wasn't asleep! Honest! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. What's happening up there?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' ... nothin' ... I wasn't asleep,
Chief. I'd'a called you 'f anything&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Something</span> bright, or was it dull,
plucked at the edge of Jason's vision.
Inside the Fane, far down at one end. A
thin, vertical bar of difference in the blaze
of light. Chin half turned, Jason stared.
What?...</p>

<p>"<i>Chief!</i> That tracer's asleep&mdash;I mean&mdash;that
there tracer's just GONE t'sleep! I
mean&mdash;Chief! It's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Jason hissed. "Holland! If
you've let anyone slip past you out of that
house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nobody did. You know me better than
that, Chief."</p>

<p>"Adams! McGillis! Johnson! What's
happening?"</p>

<p>"Nothing ..."</p>

<p>"Not a thing ..."</p>

<p>"<i>Johnson!</i>" Jason licked suddenly dry
lips. "Dammit, Johnson, report!... <i>Johnson!</i>"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Grimly, Jason watched the vertical bar of
different brightness edge back to the Fane's
East wall and disappear into the even dazzle
of the marble. He had a feeling it wasn't
any use calling Johnson again. Ever.</p>

<p>"Chief, what's up? What do we do?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh ... You, Holland, get over
to the East Entry as fast as your legs'll
stretch."</p>

<p>"There in three minutes flat!"</p>

<p>"You, too, McGillis."</p>

<p>"On my way!"</p>

<p>"Adams, you stick at that West Entry.
If anything gets past you, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Chief. I've got Johnson
to even up for."</p>

<p>Not watching how he ran, Jason hurled
himself toward the East Entry; his eyes
following, in the opposite direction, a dullness
moving in the blaze inside the Fane.
A smoothly moving, white on white, unfaced
ghost of whiteness within, a part of,
the blazing radionic light. Just as he
rounded the East end of the Fane, he
glimpsed the vertical bar of whiteness again&mdash;the
edge of the marble slab that was the
entry door, reflecting the blazing light at a
different angle. Behind it, McGillis's tightly
grinning face. Under McGillis's face, the
stab of blue-white light reflected a glancing
ray from the old-fashioned solid-missile
service pistol that Jason had insisted all
four men arm themselves with for this
assignment.</p>

<p>Over the sound of his own labored
breathing as he plunged through the East
Entry, Jason heard panting behind him.
Holland. Holland bettering his promised
three minutes&mdash;and with a forbidden disarmer
in his hand. Guiltily, Jason felt the
weight of the disarmer he had himself
secreted under his armpit.</p>

<p>Then there wasn't time for thinking or
feeling, only for running down the dazzling
half-mile inside the Fane to the Tiara. Up
ahead, the different-white shape was motionless
in front of it. Oddly, a dark, vertical
line appeared from the top to what would
be the waist of the shape. And for the
instant it took the Tiara to vanish inside,
Jason saw clearly in the radiant light the
profile of Lonnie's unmistakable face. Saw
Lonnie's eyes swivel in the direction of the
thundering echoes of their footfalls in the
silence of the Fane. Saw Lonnie turn toward
them, the dark line disappearing from waist
to top as if it had never been.</p>

<p>Once more the different-whiteness moved.
Toward them. Edging for the back wall to
skirt around them; one limb-shape fumbling
in the palm of the other.</p>

<p>"No you don't!" McGillis, ahead of
Jason, yelled, his howl drowned in the
smacking crack of his pistol.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a waver in the
different-whiteness. A small black dot appeared
against it; hung briefly, apparently
unsupported, in the air; then the undistorted
bullet dropped inertly to the floor.</p>

<p>"You <i>still</i> won't!" McGillis hurled himself,
shoulders low and legs driving, at the
shape. Two feet from it, he rebounded
sharply, trod on the rolling bullet, went
down, his head splatting dully against the
marble floor.</p>

<p>Holland grunted. Crouched to leap.
Thrust his disarmer high, ready to snap
into line.</p>

<p>"Hold it!" Jason commanded. Silently,
eyelids barely separated to endure the
dazzle, he stared at the different-whiteness
that confronted him. "I made it this time,
Lonnie," he called. "Caught up with you&mdash; No!"
His arm flung out, startling him with
the feel of his disarmer now oddly in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Don't move!"</p>

<p>The white-within-white's limb-shapes
moved up, the hand-ends one over the other.
Through the minute spaces the overlapping
fingers left, glimpses of a thin dark line
appeared. The hood was open a trifle at
mouth level, and from the opening Lonnie's
voice emerged, sifting through the protecting
screen of gloves. "You can't see me!
You <i>can't</i>!"</p>

<p>"No? Take one step sideways. Just <i>one</i>!
Stop!"</p>

<p>The different-whiteness had moved, and
Holland had moved with it; crouching now,
alertly motionless, in his new position. Jason
changed the angle of his own facing. "Now
do you think we can't see you?"</p>

<p>"But ... but how!"</p>

<p>"Your albedo is showing," Jason
chuckled harshly. "You never would take
the trouble to learn the <i>how</i> of anything,
Lonnie. Sure, your damned disguise is the
same color as the marble. Maybe even exactly
the same. But the material is different,
and the surface texture; it doesn't have the
same degree or quality of reflectivity to incident
light that marble does!</p>

<p>"Eighty years ago, even the commercial
photographers knew about albedo&mdash;one of
'em made a picture of a cat, white on white.
I told you about the reflectivity in your
stereo cube. But you wouldn't listen,
Lonnie, would you?" Jason let out a bursting
peal of laughter. "<i>So you tripped over
your own albedo!</i>"</p>

<p>Through the dying echoes of his own
laughter, Jason caught Lonnie's harsh
whisper. "You haven't got me, copper!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> black line marking the opening in
the grid suit disappeared. The barely-discernible
limb-shapes dropped, one hand-end
again fumbling at the rheostat in the
palm of the other.</p>

<p>"I'll get him, Chief!" Holland was in
action, his disarmer snapping down into
aim.</p>

<p>"No!" Jason roared. "Holland, don't!"</p>

<p>Too late. Under the pressure of Holland's
finger, the disarmer's invisible ion-stream
tightened to the thread-thin lethal intensity,
leaped out against the suit's grid. Then the
disarmer was luminous even in the dazzle;
even through the flesh of Holland's fist.
Holland screamed and squirmed and
dropped. Part of him&mdash;the part that wasn't
burned away&mdash;reached the floor.</p>

<p>The stench of carbonized flesh scoured
Jason's nostrils. Stupidly, he stared down at
the headless, shoulderless, armless torso;
black ... sooty ... against the snowy gleam
of the floor; conscious of the sidelong,
round-about approach of the different-white
figure. He'd failed again. Lonnie, in that
damned suit, was impervious.</p>

<p>Slowly, he raised his eyes from the thing
on the floor to the thing approaching. One
consolation, he himself wouldn't go on
living after this. With grim frustration, he
raised his arm in a final, fruitless gesture
and hurled the useless disarmer at the shape
of Lonnie.</p>

<p>It halted, dead, in mid-air, a yard away
from the shape-thing. Dropped straight
down, clanging against the floor.</p>

<p>A quiver as of mirth appeared to shake
the different-whiteness. It stooped. One
hand-end fumbled at the palmed rheostat,
then dropped to pick up the disarmer.
Fumbled again at the rheostat while the
figure straightened up to point the glistening
projector at Jason's belly.</p>

<p>The dark opening in the hood appeared
again.</p>

<p>Lonnie's voice chortled, "Told you I'd
use whatever you tried to smear you with.
Goodbye, Jasey ..."</p>

<p>The dark line was gone. The disarmer,
turned to lethal potential, settled in the
shape's hand-end and began to spout. Jason
went stiff. Every muscle of his body clenching
to withstand obliteration.</p>

<p>He waited for it. Tight ... except his
eyes that, in spite of themselves, opened.</p>

<p>Caught within the field, the full power
of the disarmer poured itself into the suit.
The suit's capacity absorbed it. Almost.
Then turned the combined energies on itself.</p>

<p>With the smell of frying organic matter,
slowly the grid-coveralls appeared in
dazzling radiance within the dazzle of the
Fane's lights; glowed in it; red&mdash;then
white&mdash;hot. Whiter than the light itself&mdash;far,
far lighter than any reflected rays could
make it.</p>

<p>Inside the all-encompassing, roasting grid
of the melting suit, Lonnie writhed. Faintly,
as the suit failed, his screams came through&mdash;momentarily.
Then they were gone as the
fused, molten heap subsided lower ...
lower ... began to trickle across the dazzling,
ice-white marble of the floor.</p>

<p>Afterward, had Jason known anything at
all about Lonnie's Philosophy, he'd have
immediately supplied another "rule"; making
a foursome out of the "Triple Ethic":
"If you do it yourself, make sure you know
<i>what</i> you're doing."</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
